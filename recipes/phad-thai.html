    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a Pad Thai recipe that
      <strong> truly stacks up to great Thai restaurants </strong> yet is
      totally doable for every home cook with just a trip to your every day
      grocery store. With the slippery noodles, signature sweet-savoury flavour,
      sprinkle of peanuts and tang from lime, this is a Thai food favourite for
      good reason!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pad Thai is one of the world’s most beloved noodle dishes. Along with Thai
      Green Curry and Red Curry, this is the dish by which every Thai restaurant
      is measured. In fact, I was trying to find the “best” Thai restaurant in
      my area just last week and it brought me much amusement that Pad Thai was
      the baseline of a favourable or unfavourable rating for almost every
      review!

      <li>1 1/2 cups of beansprouts</li>
      <li>1/2 cup firm tofu, cut into 3cm / 1 1/4″ batons (see photo)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup garlic chives , cut into 3cm / 1 1/4″ pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup finely chopped peanuts</li>
      <strong> FOR SERVING=:</strong>
      <li>Lime wedges (essential)</li>
      <li>Ground chilli or cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>More beansprouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place noodles in a large bowl, pour over plenty of boiling water. Soak
        for 5 minutes, then drain in a colander and quickly rinse under cold
        water. Don’t leave them sitting around for more than 5 – 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Mix Sauce in small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan (or well seasoned skillet) over
        high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until mostly cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push to one side of the pan, pour egg in on the other side. Scramble
        using the wooden spoon (add touch of extra oil if pan is too dry), then
        mix into chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Add bean sprouts, tofu, noodles then Sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Toss gently for about 1 1/2 minutes until Sauce is absorbed by the
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic chives and half the peanuts. Toss through quickly then remove
        from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, sprinkled with remaining peanuts and lime wedges on
        the side, with a sprinkle of chilli and a handful of extra beansprouts
        on the side if desired (this is the Thai way!). Squeeze over lime juice
        to taste before eating.
      </li>
    </ol>
