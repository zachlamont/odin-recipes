    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Yes, it really does taste like real fried rice.</p>

    <p>Cauliflower rice cynics, I’m talking to <strong>YOU!</strong></p>

    <p>
      And that includes me. It took me many years before I got on board the
      cauliflower rice train. And even once I was on board, it took me many
      months before I was happy enough with cauliflower fried rice to share the
      recipe with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the top tips I’ve accumulated for wickedly good cauliflower rice:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        cook it like real fried rice. Hard and fast. Keep the cauliflower
        crisp-tender, don’t let it get mushy and wet!
      </li>

      <li>A great sauce is essential. Disguise the cauliflower flavour!</li>

      <li>
        The cauliflower has to be rice-size. As opposed to tiny crumbly couscous
        size. Nobody wants mushy cauliflower-couscous!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 tbsp oil , separated (vegetable, canola, peanut)</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
      <li>1/2 onion , finely chopped</li>
      <li>75g/ 2.5 oz ham or bacon , diced</li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups frozen diced peas, carrots, corn (mix, or other diced fresh
        veg of choice)
      </li>
      <li>400g (4 cups) cauliflower rice, raw (Note 1)</li>
      <li>2 eggs , lightly whisked</li>
      <li>2 green onions , finely sliced</li>
      <p><strong>SAUCE - MIX:</strong></p>
      <li>
        1 tbsp Mirin (or Chinese Cooking Wine) (sub dry sherry or cooking sake)
        (Note 2)
      </li>
      <li>1 tbsp Oyster Sauce (sub Hoisin)</li>
      <li>1.5 tbsp soy sauce , light or all purpose (Note 3)</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil , toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
      <li>Add garlic and onion, cook for 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add ham, cook for 1 minute to release flavour.</li>
      <li>
        Add frozen vegetables, cook 2 minutes until carrot is almost cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cauliflower and Sauce. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4 minutes until
        sauce is reduced and cauliflower is almost cooked - firm, tender crisp,
        not soft and mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push the cauliflower to one side of the skillet. Add 1/2 tbsp oil, let
        it heat up briefly, then pour in egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave for 10 seconds, then leisurely scramble it. Once almost cooked,
        mix egg through cauliflower.
      </li>
      <li>Toss through green onions then serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>
