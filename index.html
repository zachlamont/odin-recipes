            Cauliflower Fried Rice

          Yes, it really does taste like real fried rice. Cauliflower rice
          cynics, Iâ€™m talking to <strong>YOU!</strong> And that includes me. It
          took me many years before I got on board the cauliflower rice train.
          And even once I was on board, it took me many months before I was
          happy enough with cauliflower fried rice to share the recipe with you.

          Thai Green Curry in 30 minutes made by freshening up store bought
          curry paste OR with a
          <strong>homemade green curry paste!</strong> Whichever way you go, the
          one essential step to make a really great green curry is to fry off
